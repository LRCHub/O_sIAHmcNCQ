Nighttime settling, no more
light to be seen;
The summer air is departing
and leaves just the two of us
standing here
Gazing at trails left behind in
the sky that soon will
disappear.
Falling steadily, nothing moves;
no one speaks
The light is still far away
as it sways, being swayed,
dancing back and forth
Rising above, higher still, and
we watch until it is no more.
Hey, if I could ask a question
of you:
Do you believe that we have to
be lonely
if we choose to say goodbye?
I turn my eyes to the fireworks
lighting up the night sky.
The summer’s leaving
but it leaves us with a feeling
so warm
we find that we are unable to
let go.
You take my hand
as if you need to find a reason
to
hold a little tighter, but trust
me, I know…
Nighttime, comes a breeze
passing through gently;
we do not say anything, there’s
no need.
Just the two of us standing
here.
Under the light of the moon
floating in the sky,
it’s come the time
for me to leave – “See you
soon,” “Think of me.”
But neither one find the words
to express
all the rest, so it goes
unheard
Lost in the radiant light up
above our heads;
“We’ll be okay…”
La, la as it seems you are
starting to lie.
With that expression as you tell
me goodbye.
Please don’t forget me,
we may say but there is really
no point
when we are blinded by tears in
our eyes.
Nighttime settling, no more
light to be seen;
The summer air is departing
and leaves just the two of us
standing here
Listening to echoes of fireworks
way up there.
And laughing.
The summer’s leaving
but it leaves us with a feeling
so warm
we find that we are unable let
go.
We stay right here
as if to try and find me meaning
behind
the lights that scatter this
lingering glow.
I had a dream where you
and I are finally up and yet
we find that we are unable to
let go.
I won’t forget you, but
although
that voice had faded to nothing
That’s a story that we still
don’t know.
