[00:33.20] Nighttime settling, no more light to be seen
[00:37.27] The summer air is departing
[00:40.64] And leaves just the two of us standing here
[00:43.80] Gazing at trails left behind in the sky that soon will disappear
[01:15.80] 
[00:49.27] Falling steadily, nothing moves, no one speaks
[00:53.25] The light is still far away
[00:56.32] As it sways, being swayed, dancing back and forth
[01:00.00] Rising above, higher still, and we watch until it is no more
[01:30.00] 
[01:21.35] Hey, if I could ask a question of you
[01:25.41] Do you believe that we have to be lonely
[01:29.57] If we choose to say goodbye?
[01:31.71] I turn my eyes to the fireworks lighting up the night sky
[02:00.21] 
[01:37.46] The summer's leaving
[01:39.48] But it leaves us with a feeling so warm
[01:42.09] We find that we are unable to let go
[01:45.57] You take my hand
[01:47.20] As if you need to find a reason to
[01:49.73] Hold a little tighter, but trust me, I know
[02:11.23] 
[02:09.21] Nighttime, comes a breeze passing through gently
[02:13.31] We do not say anything, there's no need
[02:17.48] Just the two of us standing here
[02:19.80] Under the light of the moon floating in the sky
[02:23.55] It's come the time
[02:32.55] 
[02:25.45] For me to leave – "See you soon" "Think of me"
[02:29.35] But neither one find the words to express
[02:33.35] All the rest, so it goes unheard
[02:35.69] Lost in the radiant light up above our heads
[02:39.82] "We'll be okay..."
[02:48.82] 
[02:41.32] La, la, as it seems you are starting to lie
[02:44.93] With that expression as you tell me goodbye
[02:48.58] Please don't forget me
[02:50.33] We may say but there is really no point
[02:52.90] When we are blinded by tears in our eyes
[03:12.90] 
[03:12.32] Nighttime settling, no more light to be seen
[03:16.33] The summer air is departing
[03:19.78] And leaves just the two of us standing here
[03:23.17] Listen to echoes of fireworks way up there
[03:26.75] And laughing
[03:32.75] 
[03:29.79] The summer's leaving
[03:31.33] But it leaves us with a feeling so warm
[03:33.97] We find that we are unable to let go
[03:37.66] We stay right here
[03:39.45] As if to try and find me meaning behind
[03:42.03] The lights that scatter this lingering glow
[04:03.53] 
[03:45.55] I had a dream where you
[03:47.84] And I are finally up and yet
[03:50.20] We find that we are unable to let go
[03:53.86] I won't forget you, but although
[03:56.17] That voice had faded to nothing
[03:58.41] That's a story that we still don't know
